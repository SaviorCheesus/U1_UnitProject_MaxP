# U1_UnitProject_MaxP
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> Hello there. The project I made uses the WASD keys to treverse through space. You use the space key to launch a projectile. You would use the projectiles to solve puzzles and pass obstacles.<p>
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
The game was inspired by older over the top games that would mainly have the character remain in the center of the screen, while the rest of the environment would move around them. The puzzle solving aspect was mostly inspired by old LoZ games.
